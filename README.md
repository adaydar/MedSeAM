This repo contains the Official Pytorch implementation of our paper at ICVGIP'24:

[Med-SeAM: Medical Context Aware Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Anomaly Classification in Knee MRI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3702250.3702276) by Akshay Daydar, Ajay Kumar Reddy, Sonal Kumar, Arijit Sur, Hanif Laskar

![MedSeAM_architecture](./MedSeAM_final_arch.png) Figure: Overall schematic of the proposed MedSeAM model with Stage I includes the Disease Context Learning pretext task, and Stage II includes the downstream task of abnormality classification in knee MRI scans. * indicates the pre-trained modules that are fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

Requirements

    Linux
    Python3 3.8.10
    Pytorch 1.13.1
    train and test with A100 GPU

Prepare Dataset:

    1. Kindly check "https://github.com/adaydar/MtRA-Unet/tree/main" repository for dataset preparation.
    2. Kindly check preprocessing_entropy_dataset.py in utils folder for entropy map generation.
    2. Then kindly check the "config" file before running the training and testing code.

Training and Testing:

Prepare the dataset and then run the following command for pre-training:

    python3 pretraining.py

For Downstream classification task, run
    
    python3 downstream.py
    
For Testing, run

    python3 test.py
